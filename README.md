Hypothesis 
X-squared = 14363, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16

There is an association between providers who can order Durable Medical Equipment in hospitals  and providers who are also covered under Medicare Part B and have the DME benefits covered. 

My null hyptohesis would be that there is no correlation between the two categories and they are not related whatsoever. 

In this case, my p value is 2.2e-16 which is less than .05 so the null hypthesis can be rejected in this case. 2.2e-16 is a very small number and since the P-value is less than the 5% significant or .05, the null hypthesis will be ignored.

2. T-Test:
